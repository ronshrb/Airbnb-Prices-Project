# Airbnb Prices Project
Data science project, its goal is to predict if a property is expensive or not.
I have worked on this project in order to gain more exprience and explore different programing tools, in working with large data and machine learning tools.

## Tools and Programing Languages:
1. Databricks
2. Python (Pandas, pyspark, matplotlibs, scikit learn)
3. SQL
4. Spark

## Files

# data
Airbnb Properties Data  - A csv file containing 6760 rows and 54 columns.

# notebooks
data loading - Loading the data and create train and test spark dataframes.
data analysis sql - Data analysis in SQL before processing.
data analysis python - Data analysis in python before processing.
classes and functions - Functions that are used for processing and analyzing the data.
results - Data processing and prediction.

# to be added
data analysis python - Data analysis in python before processing.
